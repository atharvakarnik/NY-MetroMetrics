# MetroMetrics - A Data Engineering Project to Analyze NY Metro Ridership

Welcome to the MTA NY Metro Ridership Data Analysis project! Here I've been exploring the MTA New York Metro system's ridership over past few years. The project is an ongoing effort, and I'm continuously enhancing my methods and findings by adapting to problem staments with suitable methods and technologies.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: For data extraction and analysis.
- **SQL**: For data querying.
- **DuckDB**: For data storage and efficient querying.

## Problem Statements Tackled:
Some of the questions I tried to answer:

- **Daily Ridership Trends**: Analyzing the daily ridership trends for the MTA subways through post-pandemic time to identify fluctuations and patterns.

- **Monthly Distribution Analysis**: Examining the monthly distribution of total estimated ridership to understand how ridership varies across different months.

- **Weekday Ridership Patterns**: Investigating the average ridership by weekdays to determine which days see higher or lower usage of the subway system.

- **Comparison Across Transportation Modes**: Comparing the normalized weekly trends of different transportation modes, including subways, buses, Metro-North, and others, to understand the relative usage and popularity.

- **Clustering of Ridership Trends**: Clustering different ridership trends to group similar patterns and analyze common characteristics across these clusters.

These analyses provide insights into how ridership varies across time, days of the week, and different modes of transportation, helping to uncover patterns and potential areas for optimization in the MTA system.
